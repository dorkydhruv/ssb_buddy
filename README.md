**Project Name:** SSB Hub - Mobile Application UI (v0)

**Objective:** Design a clean and intuitive mobile UI with three primary tabs for users to navigate between SSB center live chat rooms, discussion platforms, and user profiles. Each tab should be represented by an appropriate icon, and the interface should incorporate the following features:

---

### **1. Tab Structure**

- **Tab 1: SSB Centers (Icon: SSB Logo or Military Symbol)**

  - Grid view displaying different SSB centers as tiles.
  - Each tile leads to a specific centerâ€™s chat room.
  - Incorporate sections for "Tips from Experienced Candidates" within each center's page.
  - Users can browse tips categorized by expertise level (repeater/recommended candidates).

- **Tab 2: Discussions (Icon: Discussion Bubble/Reddit-like Icon)**

  - Reddit-like discussion platform with different threads tagged by SSB center.
  - Users can upvote, comment, and post discussions.
  - Ability to filter discussions by "Popular," "Recent," or specific SSB centers.
  - Option for users to attach multimedia (images, files) in their posts.

- **Tab 3: Profile (Icon: User/Profile Icon)**
  - User profile page where candidates can update their personal information, track preparation progress, and view achievement badges.
  - Include a calendar with upcoming SSB events.
  - Users can view their engagement stats (posts, comments, badges earned).
